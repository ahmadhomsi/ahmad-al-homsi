 > the diffrent between  old <div  and in the html5  :


* web page authors used <div  elements to group
together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a
header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes
to indicate the role of the <div  element in the structure of the page.

* HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already.

* The <nav> element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.

* The <header> and <footer>
elements can be used for:
●● The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
●● A header or footer for an
individual <article> or
<section> within the page. 


 * so we see here the new elements in html5 provid the abilty to control all parts of the web page and are more specific than the old elements .

 * Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript you shold to know that :



 * you must first plan the big picture of the topic and then you have to break down the big picture into several steps by first setting the goal of the task that you want to achive and you can think about that as a dilemma  that must be solved through the computer and then you have to design the text that you want and that throgh dividing tasks by outline and writing down the steps that you wont to start through and you have to writing down step that you wont to start through and you have to write the code for each step in the programming language file . it is good to spend time desingning the script you want before starting to write it.


* And here we have the steps to write the code after you have written all the steps in a diagram that the computer can understand. You must understand the words you use in the computer. You must also learn and understand how to combine words together. Art in order to create code with learning and focus in the language you want to use

up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.

* what is An array ?
t is a type of variable that stores a list of variables, not just one value, and it is very useful when you create a file that contains many values ​​and variables, and you will not face a problem in that.

* It is important to know that array and the values ​​in it are numbered starting from zero, not a single number. This thing is done automatically and is called the index. Here we also learn how to retrieve a file and also each array has a property called the length that carries the number of the array elements.
