# git 

* what the meaning of git :Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.


* the git performs  most of the local operation because it presserves some of the solutions as we  have said in the definition and one of it is main benefits is that it does the work even with the interruption of the internet because it uses the local processes saved in the device and this is very impotant thing 


* it also tracks all the changes that occur to the files to reduce any damage when one of the files is broken . it also keeps the files in local database and even when the file is changed a local database is committed .
