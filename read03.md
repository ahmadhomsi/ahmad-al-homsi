* ol>
The ordered list is created with
the ol> element.

* li>
Each item in the list is placed
between an opening li> tag
and a closing li> tag. (The li
stands for list item.)

* ul>
The unordered list is created
with the  ul> element.

* dl>
The definition list is created with
the  dl> element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.

* dt>
This is used to contain the term
being defined (the definition
term).

* dd>
This is used to contain the
definition.

* There are three t  ypes of HTML lists: ordered,
unordered, and definition.
 Ordered lists use numbers.
 Unordered lists use bullets.
 Definition lists are used to define terminology.
 Lists can be nested inside one another.

* Border
Every box has a border (even if
it is not visible or is specified to
be 0 pixels wide). The border
separates the edge of one box
from another.

* Margin
Margins sit outside the edge
of the border. You can set the
width of a margin to create a
gap between the borders of two
adjacent boxes.



* padding
The padding property allows
you to specify how much space
should appear between the
content of an element and its
border.
The value of this property is
most often specified in pixels
(although it is also possible to
use percentages or ems). If a
percentage is used, the padding
is a percentage of the browser
window (or of the containing box
if it is inside another box).



* The display property allows
you to turn an inline element
into a block-level element or vice
versa, and can also be used to
hide an element from the page.
The values this property can
take are:
* inline
This causes a block-level
element to act like an inline
element.
* block
This causes an inline element to
act like a block-level element.
* inline-block
This causes a block-level
element to flow like an inline
element, while retaining other
features of a block-level element.
* none
This hides an element from the
page. In this case, the element
acts as though it is not on the
page at all (although a user could
still see the content of the box if
they used the view source option
in their browser).

 ## Chapter 2: 

 * ARRAYS :


 You should consider using an
array whenever you are working
with a list or a set of values that
are related to each other.
Arrays are especially helpful
when you do not know how
many items a list will contain
because, when you create the
array, you do not need to specify
how many values it will hold.
If you don't know how many
items a list will contain, rather
than creating enough variables
for a long list (when you might
only use a small percentage
of them), using an array is
considered a better solution.

## Chapter 4: 

* Falsy values are treated as if they
are fa 1 se. The table to the left
shows a hi ghScore variable with
a series of values, all of which
are falsy

* Truthy values are treated as if
they are true. Almost everything
that is not in the falsy table can
be treated as if it were true.

* A unary operator returns a
result with just one operand.
Here you can see an if
statement checking for the
presence of an element. If the
element is found, the result is
truthy, so the first set of code is
run. If it is not found, the second
set is run instead.
