How do you update web pages and make them appear beautifully and attractively for the sake of users and this thing we will do by using css as css is a program for designing web pages through which it determines how the shape of the web page should be and other things like specifying colors, backgrounds and things  The other 
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
Declarations indicate how
the elements referred to in
the selector should be styled.
Declarations are split into two
parts (a property and a value),
and are separated by a colon.
Properties indicate the aspects
of the element you want to
change. For example, color, font,
width, height and border.
Values specify the settings
you want to use for the chosen
properties. For example, if you
want to specify a color property
then the value is the color you
want the text in these elements
to be.
You can also include CSS rules
within an HTML page by placing
them inside a <style> element,
which usually sits inside the
<head> element of the page.
The <style> element should use
the type attribute to indicate
that the styles are specified in
CSS. The value should be text/
css.
When building a site with more
than one page, you should use
an external CSS style sheet. This:
●● Allows all pages to use the
same style rules (rather than
repeating them in each page).
●● Keeps the content separate
from how the page looks.
●● Means you can change the
styles used across all pages
by altering just one file
(rather than each individual
page).
Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
XX Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
XX CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.



 there are three common ways in
which you can indicate your choice of colors (plus extra
ways made available in CSS3)
*  Color terminology, as there are some terms that are very
helpful to understand when it comes to picking colors
* Contrast, and ensuring that your text is readable
*  Background colors for behind either your entire page or
parts of a page


 * The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:
rgb values
These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)
hex codes
These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80
color names
There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan

Color not only brings your s XX ite to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.
* There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
*  Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
* It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
* CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
