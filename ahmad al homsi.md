the writer need to tall us that point which any text editor for coding is that one you enjoy using the most scond point is that editoer A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer
and the most important feutuar 1.) code completion; 2.) syntax
highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need themHTML and CSS more
efficiently. There is a kind of shorthand language called Emmet that
can help. Emmet will speed up your code writing faster than you can
imagine. Some text editors come with Emmet built right in, or
Emmet can be added by the means of an extension.
Using The Software That Already
Comes With Your Computer 
Third-Party Options
Ok, what about third-party options? Letâ€™s talk about software like:
Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom,
Brackets, and Sublime Text. These text editors can all be downloaded
and installed to your computer from their respective websites. Each
of these titles do have some if not all of the features that we talked
about earlier, and most of this software is absolutely free! They are
widely used in web development today.
The Command Line Introduction

 
Linux has a graphical user interface and it works pretty much like the GUI's on other systems that you are familiar with such as Windows and OSX. This tutorial won't focus on these as I reckon you can probably figure that part out by yourself. This tutorial will focus instead on the command line (also known as a terminal) running Bash.

So what are they exactly?
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

Basic Navigation

Introduction
In this section, we'll learn the basics of moving around the system. Many tasks rely on being able to get to, or reference the correct location in the system.
The first command we are going to learn is pwd which stands for Print Working Directory. (You'll find that a lot of commands in linux are named as an abbreviation of a word or words describing them. This makes it easier to remember them.) 

In the previous commands we started touching on something called a path. I would like to go into more detail on them now as they are important in being proficient with Linux. Whenever we refer to either a file or directory on the command line, we are in fact referring to a path. ie. A path is a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system
More About Files
After the previous section I'm sure you're keen and eager to get stuck into some more commands and start doing some actual playing about with the system. We will get to that shortly but first we need to cover some theory so that when we do start playing with the system you can fully understand why it is behaving the way it is and how you can take the commands you learn even further

What happens is that Holiday Photos is seen as two command line arguments. cd moves into whichever directory is specified by the first command line argument only. To get around this we need to identify to the terminal that we wish Holiday Photos to be seen as a single command line argument. There are two ways to go about this, either way is just as valid
