# chapter 15  LAYOUT


* This involves learning about how designing for a screen can be
different to designing for other mediums (such as print). In this
chapter we will:

* Explore different ways to position elements using normal
flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and floats.

* Discover how various devices have different screen sizes
and resolution, and how this affects the design process.

* Learn the difference between fixed width and liquid layouts,
and how they are created.
*  Find out how designers use grids to make their page
designs look more professional.

* Building Blocks
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

* Containing Elements
If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

* Controll ing the
Position of El ements
Lorem Ipsum
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do
eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et
dolore magna aliqua.


* To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use
box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom
and left or right it should be placed. (You will meet these when we
introduce the positioning schemes on the following pages.)

* left
The left-hand side of the box
should not touch any other
elements appearing in the same
containing element.
* right
The right-hand side of the
box will not touch elements
appearing in the same containing
element.
* both
Neither the left nor right-hand
sides of the box will touch
elements appearing in the same
containing element.
* none
Elements can touch either side.


* Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web
designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).

* Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography)
is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are
organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them
position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.

*  div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.

* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

* The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

*  Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

*  Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

*  Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

 * CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
 
* You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
