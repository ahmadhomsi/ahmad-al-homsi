 > the diffrent between  old <div  and in the html5  :


* web page authors used <div  elements to group
together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a
header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes
to indicate the role of the <div  element in the structure of the page.

* HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already.

* The <nav> element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.

* The <header> and <footer>
elements can be used for:
●● The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
●● A header or footer for an
individual <article> or
<section> within the page. 


 * so we see here the new elements in html5 provid the abilty to control all parts of the web page and are more specific than the old elements .
